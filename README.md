# Fruit Inspection project

## Overview
In the dynamic landscape of international trade, ensuring the quality of imported and exported goods is crucial. 
In collaboration with a data analyst student, we embarked on an interdisciplinary journey to create a modern solution to this problem.

Our project centers around addressing the quality control challenges faced by import/export companies dealing with fresh produce, particularly fruits.
